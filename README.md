_HexiCrates v0.1 rev 0_

<p style="text-align:justify">
HexiCrates is a very simple reward plugin created for Hexicraft. The idea is simple:
a *crate* containing in-game items can be given to a player as a reward. The crate is
added to the player's que and when they (the player) is ready to open the crate
they can do so with a single in-game command.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
In it'sÂ most basic form, a crate contains only in-game items (diamond, coal, dirt,
stone etc.). Crates are ranked - the more valuable a crate is the more valuable the
items in it are. This ranking is arbitrary and can be ignored completely (see config).
When a crate is opened it's contents are randomly selected from a list. The listed
items can contain weights to make some items more probable than others.
